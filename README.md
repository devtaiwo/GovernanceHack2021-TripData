## Problem Definition

Monitor, Measure, Report & Verification of transport/journey events and its impact on the economy. This events includes and will not be limited to :
- travel duration and delays
- police checkpoints
- accidents
- parked vehicles
- pot holes / bad road segments

We seek to collect the transport data directly from mobile devices and IOT camera systems. Inference on the impact of the trasport service will be extracted from data collected to prevent bias introduced with simple survey questions.
